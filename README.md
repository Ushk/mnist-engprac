# MNIST Engineering Practice

This repository was inspired by Joel Grus' excellent livecoding video, which can be found here: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw)

Disclaimer: A significant proportion of the code strongly resembles, while not generally being the same as, the code written by Joel during his livecoding tutorial. My aim has been to extend it, for example extending it from his XOR and FizzBuzz to MNIST, including things like softmax, unit tests, etc. I'm a big fan of the way he writes (Type checking!), so I have tried to code in a way that is as similar in style as possible.
